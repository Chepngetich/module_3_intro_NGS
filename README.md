# module_3_intro_NGS
This repository contains the training material for the 2018 Bioinformatics Community of Practice at the BecA-ILRI Hub.
The aim of this module is to introduce basic sequencing knowledge and different kind of applications in Biology and related Bioinformatics analysis. During this week, you will also learn about alignement and mapping algorithms, the different file formats used in NGS data analysis and the basic downstream applications based on DNASeq and RNASeq. In a previous modules, you learned how to code and use the bash shell to interact with your computer through a command line interface and will get the chance to put these skills into practice to get started with the NGS data analysis.

Please check the [schedule](https://github.com/bixcop18/module_3_intro_NGS/blob/master/schedule.md) for more details about the week schedule and links to the different sessions materials.
