We will be using reads for two samples of Arabidopsis (columbia the reference genome and Seattle a wilder variety)
For each sample, we have 2 fastq files: R1 and R2. 
Seattle_reads and Columbia_reads folders contain respectively fastq files relative to the Columbia and Seattle samples.
The reference genome files are in the Reference folder.
