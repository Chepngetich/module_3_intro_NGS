Exercise 2: Using BLAST

GW2 is an important gene for controlling grain yield in rice.

1. Find the orthologue(s) of GW2 in Maize and Arabidopsis using the reference files you have already downloaded using BLAST

2. Do Maize and Arabidopsis have any likely paralogues of GW2?

3. Use BLAST find similar sequences to GW2 in the NCBI non-redundant protein database

4. What protein domains does GW2 have?

5. Perform a multiple sequence alignment between GW2 orthologues from at least 8 different species.

6. Which species has the most similar sequence to the rice GW2?

7. Are some areas more conserved than others?

Additional exercises:

Sequences important for regulation of genes can often be found in the promoters of genes.
8. Extract the promoter region (2kb) upstream of the Maize GW2 orthologue
		- Hint: BEDtools is useful for extracting sequences from FASTA files
